Kaggle: Rotten Tomatoes Movie Reviews  
====================================
This project is associated with the Rotten Tomatoes Kaggle competition,  
in which competitors are given approximately 150k movie review sentences  
and must use this to predict the sentiment associated with approximately 60k reviews.  
  
We experimented with two models, SVM and random forests, to achieve a test set accuracy  
of just over 60%, which represents a lift of approximately 1.15.  
  
I also prototyped a custom k-NN n-gram model, but initial cross-validation results  
did not prove to demonstrate reliability.
